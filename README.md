## Overview

`clip-diff` is a fork of an existing Visual Studio Code extension that allows you to apply diff patches directly from your clipboard to the currently open file. This can be particularly useful for developers who frequently work with patches and need a quick way to apply them without leaving the editor.

## Features

- **Apply Diff Patch from Clipboard**: Apply a diff patch from the clipboard to the active file in the editor.
- **Error Handling**: Provides informative messages if the clipboard content is not a valid diff patch or if no active editor is found.

## Usage

1. Copy a diff patch to your clipboard.
2. Open the file you want to apply the patch to in Visual Studio Code.
3. Open the Command Palette by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`.
4. Type `Apply Diff Patch from Clipboard` and select the command.
